Jan Ostmans Drum8 Attiny85 module
***************************************************

You can also program the Paperface to be a 8-voice polyphonic drum sampler.

Here CV1 selects among 8 available drums sounds and CV2 adjusts the pitch.
CV3 is used as a rising edge trigger.

It is polyphonic so changing the drum sound after a trigger and retriggering wont cut out the playing drum sound.
 

You can use the wav2c utility for creating the arrays with the drum sounds so you can have custom sounds.
